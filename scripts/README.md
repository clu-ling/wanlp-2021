<h3>Dialect_country_level_experiement_1 </h3>
<p>This experiement uses Aravec (300 - skipgram - ngram ) and cnn-lstm network. The predicted labels are in the prediction_files folder. By using NADI scorer, we can get MACRO F1: 15.92%. These scores on dev and test predcited labels are also in the prediction_files folder </p>


<h3>Dialect_country_level_experiement_2 </h3>
<p>This experiement uses Aravec (300 - cbow - unigram) and cnn-lstm network. The predicted labels are in the prediction_files folder. By using NADI scorer, we can get MACRO F1: 14.75%. These scores on dev and test predcited labels are also in the prediction_files folder </p>


<h3>Dialect_country_level_experiement_3 </h3>
<p>This experiement uses Aravec (300 - cbow - ngram) and cnn-lstm network. The predicted labels are in the prediction_files folder. By using NADI scorer, we can get MACRO F1: 15.66%. These scores on dev and test predcited labels are also in the prediction_files folder </p>

<h3>Only_LSTM_AraVec_4 </h3>
<p>This is the best experiment so far. This experiement uses Aravec (300 - cbow - ngram) and lstm network. The predicted labels are in the prediction_files folder. By using NADI scorer, we can get MACRO F1: 19.23%. These scores on dev and test predcited labels are also in the prediction_files folder </p>
